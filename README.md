## Migration networks and housing prices analysis and ML tools
This repository is used to model and analyze the housing prices in Israel (1998-2021) and to study the migration networks in Israel (2000-2017)
For now, we have one project ready to be published:
### Two decades of housing prices in Israel: A Machine Learning approach

#### Project description


#### Example of feature importances in a linear regression model (MLR) employed on the world map
![](Figures/mlr_beta_h2o_QBO_ENSO_ENSO2_fig_6.png?raw=true "mlr")
The Î² coefficients for the water vapor anomalies MLR analysis in the 82.54 hPa level from 2005 to 2019.

#### Example of time series reconstruction using linear regression models (MLR) and other ML models
![](Figures/Out_of_sample_predictions_SWOOSH_ML.png?raw=true "swoosh")
Out of sample model predictions of deseasonalized and standardized equitorial water vapor at 82.54 hPa. The various models are RF (blue), SVM (orange), MLP (green) and MLR (red). The observations are from SWOOSH (purple). Note the three forecast "busts":2010-D-2011-JFM, 2015-OND and 2016-OND.
